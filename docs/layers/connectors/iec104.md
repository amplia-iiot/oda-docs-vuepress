### IEC 104

This connector enable communication via [IEC 104 Protocol](https://github.com/amplia-iiot/oda/tree/master/oda-connectors/iec104).

Allow the transfer of data and operations with a SCADA third-system that implements an IEC 104 master (client).

#### Dependencies

This module requires the following modules:
* __Scada Dispatcher__: Needed to process the payloads and de/serialize its content.

#### Configuration

To configure IEC 104 connector, a file named _es.amplia.oda.connector.iec104.cfg_ must be created with the next parameters:
* __localAddress__: *Required parameter*. Specify the direction of the third system the connector have to send the data. 
'localhost' is a good host to do tests with.
* __localPort__: *Required parameter*. Port though the connector have to connect to the host.
* __originatorAddress__: *Required parameter*. Direction of the IEC104 client
* __commonAddress__: *Required parameter*. Direction of the IEC104 slave that the connector is using.
* __spontaneousEnabled__: *Required parameter*. Specify if the connector will send immediately the data or will alloc it 
in a cache waiting for a request from the master.

In other words, _es.amplia.oda.connector.iec104.cfg_ will have the content:
```
localAddress=localhost
localPort=2404
originatorAddress=0
commonAddress=1
spontaneousEnabled=true
```
